# hello

Hi All!

I'm Jing and I'm new here. I'm now a graduate student (who is still struggling with English haha). I like cooking and drawing. My favoriate dishes are ramen and okonomiyaki! (Yeah I do like Japanese food and the sauce.) I learned a little pipa playing before but am not good at it. Happy to meet you!
